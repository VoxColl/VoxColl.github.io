title: 1.4 Character Keywords

Keywords are the things you'd use to describe your characters personality and traits.

They're commonly words like Hopeful, Caustic, Athletic.

On your character sheet, you'll create 5 slots for 5 different Keywords. You'll be able to pick the Keywords which closely describe the character you're hoping to create. These Keywords will provide minor stat bonuses to specific Attributes or Traits, with greater bonuses also having drawbacks. 
Think of a character like Grima Wormtongue from Lord of the Rings. Probably has a decently high Influence/Speech, but considering his nature, not a great Psyche/Fortitude. (He literally is a manipulative, sniveling coward.)

Until the list is complete, the process as of now will be, find an adjective, make your case for it and what Attribute or Traits it'd relate to, and whether it'd also have a greater benefit to one stat with a downside for another.

With that adjective, an example of how that is represented in the character is also recommended. A short description of a scenario, either a memory or a hypothetical situation, something to show the personality for the player's sake to remember key traits and to build on them.

Keywords can also be exchanged, either during pivotal moments, level ups or due to feeling less than enthused about the character you have created. If a Keyword isn't feeling right for the character anymore, it doesn't need to stay.

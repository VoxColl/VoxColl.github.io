title: 1.6 Character Creation
draft: false

## Tools Required
---
This RPG is being created with Obsidian.MD, so the character creating is going to be based around turning a Canvas into a Character Sheet.

We're going to recommend a specific order in which to create your character sheet.

1. History
2. Keywords
3. Abilities
4. Attributes
5. Equipment/Magic Items
6. Resources

Of course, you're allowed to pick whichever of the steps works best for you, and start with that one instead. 

But, before all that, I'd recommend creating a Folder with which you'll place everything inside.

## 1. History
---
Create a Note in your folder for the History of your character. 

You can find out more about writing your Character History in [[1.3 Character History]].

Once you've finished the Note, you can move onto the next step.

## 2. Keywords
---
Either have a look through [[1.4 Character Keywords]], or discuss with your Game Runner the core traits of who your character is. 

Select or create 5 Keywords, and place them into a new Note named for your Character.

e.g. {Mr. Foster Keywords}

Remember, you can swap out these Keywords on level ups, during Pivotal Moments or on having a discussion with your Runner, so don't feel like you need to make a concrete decision.

## 3. Abilities
---
Have a look through [[2.3 Choice Ability List]], or read [[2.1 Building Abilities]] and have a discussion with your Runner about the kinds of things you'd like your Character to be able to do.

Select or create 5 Abilities to begin with, and place them into a new Note named for your Character.

e.g. {Mr. Foster Abilities}

Just like Keywords, you can swap out these Abilities on level ups, during Pivotal Moments or on having a discussion with your Runner.

## 4. Attributes
---
A level one character can start with:
- 21 Attribute points as a standardized start.
- 6d6 (with 2 rerolls if total under 19) as a randomized start.
- An agreed value with the Game Runner for the campaign.

Your Runner will let you know which of these to use. Consult [[1.2 Character Attributes]] for any information you need to make decisions about where to place your attributes.

#### Standard Start

>Take your 21 Attribute points and distribute them into the Attributes you feel make the most sense for the character you have created so far.

>Split each pool of Attributes into their Offensive and Defensive subtypes.

#### Randomized Start

>Roll 6d6, leave the die, and record the result. If the total is less than 19, pick 2 of your die and reroll them.

>Take your total points and distribute them into the Attributes you feel make the most sense for the character you have created so far.

>Split each pool of Attributes into their Offensive and Defensive subtypes.

#### Agreed Value Start

>Discuss with your Game Runner the appropriate amount of total Attribute points for the pitched Campaign.

>Take your total points and distribute them into the Attributes you feel make the most sense for the character you have created so far.

>Split each pool of Attributes into their Offensive and Defensive subtypes.

{Canvas Instruction to come}

## 5. Equipment/Magic Items
---
Wait until section is finished.
Testing for Item amounts is required.

{Note for this too}

## 6. Resources
---
Setup a Note for the amount of resources your character currently has.

Look at the Table in [[1.5 Character Resources]].



{Inline Elements potentially}

{Flesh out further}

## Setting up your Canvas
---
Should look like this, or similar. Will be refining as this process goes along.

Canvas can also be used for Inventory, Notes, anything really.

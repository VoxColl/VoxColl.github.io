He always tries to chat up a storm, while Mr. Foster just sits patiently until he has a bite on the end of his line.\n>\n>>You know what you've done.\n>>\n>>_I know._\n>\n>He tries to enjoy the company, he truly does... but... \n>\n>>83...\n>>\n>>_I know._\n>\n>A bite! Mr. Cuttle is almost more excited than Mr. Foster is, but with a steely focus, Mr. Foster is already reeling in what seems to be the largest fish of his season so far.\n>\n>>78 men. 5 Women.\n>>\n>>_There were no children._\n>\n>The reeling gets faster. There were no children.\n>\n>>There were no children?\n>>\n>>_..._\n>\n>Mr. Foster is in state of such zeal at the thought of his potential bounty and night of good eating, he doesn't notice Mr. Cuttle fall silent. \n>\n>>Are you sure there were no children?\n>>\n>>_Shut up._\n>\n>The line breaks. Mr. Foster curses in such a foul manner, the reaction of Mr. Cuttle would ordinarily be one of disgust. Mr. Foster flinches in expectation of the dressing down he's about receive about \"proper manners\".\n>\n>He waits.\n>\n>He waits.\n>\n>He turns to see why Mr. Cuttle hasn't immediately started swatting him, and-\n>\n>>What about that one time in the Citadel?\n>>\n>>_THERE WAS NO TIME IN THE CITADEL._\n>\n>\"Mr. Cuttle?\"\n>\n>>Tobias Wayne was his name, was it not?\n>>\n>>_..._\n>>\n>>Wasn't it?\n>>\n>>_...yes._\n>>\n>>Oh, but you didn't kill him, did you?\n>>\n>>_No._\n>>\n>>No. You just... left him there.

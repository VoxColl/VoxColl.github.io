Abilities can be used from the Free Ability List for all characters, or they can choose from their allotment of selected Character Abilities, which can be found in the Choice Ability List.

While not all abilities have been created, and not all abilities will be able to created, the basic understanding has been provided here to use, and then create your own abilities.

Simply, the magic system, the combat system and the social system all work upon intention, and the simplest intention is the most powerful. A single word can provide the most potential, therefore a single verb is the base of an ability. Multi word abilities may come later, but for now this is the basis for the entire magic system.

Look at the Free Ability List. Each of them are single words, describing actions that can be taken. Each is a single word, with a variety of options that can be taken with them.

To create a new ability, a word must be chosen, an intention provided and an effect decided. 

Let's take one that is already on the Choice Ability List. 

Command. One definition of Command is "to have control or authority over". Pretty simple, you tell someone what to do and they do it, within reason.

Therefore the ability will provide a character with the option to tell a character to do something, and that character will do so, up until the point of taking an action that would cause damage.

> [!ability-social-type] **Command**
>
>***Force an enemy to comply with a short request, demand or statement.***
>
>Examples: "Drop your sword!" "Run away!" "Eat that melon!"

It will also require being within Earshot distance, understanding the Language being spoken, and cost an Ability Point.

> [!ability-social-type] **Command**
>**Reach** | *Earshot* - 10 Moves
>
>**Cost** | 1 AP
>
>**Requirement** | Language Understanding
>
>***Force an enemy to comply with a short request, demand or statement.***
>
>Examples: "Drop your sword!" "Run away!" "Eat that melon!"

Now, while Command could come most Attributes and Traits, the thing that makes the most sense is their Influence.
Therefore, we'll take the whole of someone's Influence vs. the whole of someone's Psyche as the contest or threshold to beat, and on a success, the effect will happen. 

> [!ability-social-type] **Command** | {*Influence*}
> 
>**Reach** | *Earshot* - 10 Moves
>
>**Cost** | 1 AP
>
>**Requirement** | Language Understanding
>
>***Force an enemy to comply with a short request, demand or statement.***
>
>Make a contested roll with your total Influence vs. an enemy's total Psyche, as a contest or threshold, and on a success the target must comply up until the point of taking an action that would cause damage.
>
>Examples: "Drop your sword!" "Run away!" "Eat that melon!"

Another ability we'll create is to Heal. If a definition is needed, you may provide one.

To Heal you must be within view, and spend 2 Ability Points. For each Trait, the amount of healing provided will be the Main Trait score.

> [!ability-buff-type] **Heal** | {Psyche, Soul}
>**Reach** | *Discernible View* - 10 Moves
>
>**Cost** | 2 AP
>
>***Provide health to someone who currently has been damaged or injured.***
>
>The amount of healing given is based on the Main Trait chosen and the associated benefits from items.

To provide more opportunity for different focuses of Characters, 4 different effects will be created. Psyche and Soul will be the Attributes used, and to provide more opportunity for different focuses of Characters, 4 different effects will be created. They'll be split into the different Traits for the effects. 
- Acuity as an offensive Trait will provide a bonus to the targets next Attack. 
- Fortitude as a defensive Trait will help remove effects currently on the target.
- Rend as an offensive Trait will steal health from surrounding combatants for the target.
- Will as a defensive Trait will provide a bonus to the targets next Defend.

> [!ability-buff-type] **Heal** | {Psyche, Soul}
>**Reach** | *Discernible View* - 10 Moves
>
>**Cost** | 2 AP
>
>***Provide health to someone who currently has been damaged or injured.***
>
>The amount of healing given is based on the Main Trait chosen and the associated benefits from items.
>
>- **Acuity**: Restore health equal to Acuity score and provide +2 to target's next Attack.
>- **Fortitude**: Restore health equal to Fortitude score and remove a status effect from the person healed.
>- **Rend**: Restore health equal to Rend score, remove +1 health from up to 3 enemies in melee of target and provide that total as health as well.
>- **Will**: Restore health equal to Will score and provide +2 to targets next Defend.

Lastly, we'll create a much more fate focused ability, Doom. 

There are a couple of definitions, so this ability could go a couple different ways. As a noun it means "Inevitable destruction or ruin.".

As a verb, it can mean to condemn to ruination, or cause an inevitable, unfavourable end.
For us, this means we'll be using it as a means of altering the fate of something to fail. 

> [!ability-fate-type] **Doom**
>***Cause an impending action to fail, with harmful consequences for the target.***

So, we'll use Soul as this seems like an ability caused by the Essence of a character, and we'll use the Traits for an Offensive and Defensive option.

> [!ability-fate-type] **Doom** | {Soul}
>***Cause an impending action to fail, with harmful consequences for the target.***

The actual effect will be to cause the targets next successful ability to fail, and rebound against themselves. To make it less implicitly powerful, we'll also target the Total of someone's Soul.

> [!ability-fate-type] **Doom** | {Soul}
>***Cause an impending action to fail, with harmful consequences for the target.***
>
>Make a contested or threshold roll with your selected Trait/s vs. your target's total Soul.
>On a success cause the targets next ability to fail and backfire.

Rend will cause more physically detrimental effects to the target, whereas Will has the chance of extending the effect for longer. 

> [!ability-fate-type] **Doom** | {Soul}
>***Cause an impending action to fail, with harmful consequences for the target.***
>
>Make a contested or threshold roll with your selected Trait/s vs. your target's total Soul.
>On a success cause the targets next ability to fail and backfire.
>
>- **Rend**: Target takes all effects, damage or loses all benefit of next ability used, and takes a point of Vulnerability, where on the next successful attack, the target takes double damage.
>- **Will**: Target takes all effects, damage or loses all benefit of next ability used, and takes a point of Disruption, where on a further ability the target wishes to use, they have -5 to the total score.

As this is pretty powerful, we'll limit this to one use per day, be on a target within sight, and have it cost more to use.

> [!ability-fate-type] **Doom** | {Soul}
>**Reach** | *Discernible View* - 10 Moves
>
>**Cost** | 3 AP
>
>**Uses** | One Per Day
>
>***Cause an impending action to fail, with harmful consequences for the target.***
>
>Make a contested or threshold roll with your selected Trait/s vs. your target's total Soul.
>On a success cause the targets next ability to fail and backfire.
>
>- **Rend**: Target takes all effects, damage or loses all benefit of next ability used, and takes a point of Vulnerability, where on the next successful attack, the target takes double damage.
>- **Will**: Target takes all effects, damage or loses all benefit of next ability used, and takes a point of Disruption, where on a further ability the target wishes to use, they have -5 to the total score.

Hopefully this provides some insight into how to build abilities in this system, and the ways to balance and integrate them into the current mechanics while keeping the fun of the game as the core focus.

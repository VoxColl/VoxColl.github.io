These abilities are the non-standard things characters will be able to do that fit with the choices you've made for them. The attributes underneath each ability are suggested attributes for using these abilities, but with a sufficient argument, others can be used.
Every ability on this list will cost something to use, but there may be other ways of using these abilities without expending certain Resources.

### *How does the game generally work?*

The Game Runner will create a reasonable Threshold for your success or failure for most situations.

For anything else that gets left up to the fate of the dice, it will be a contested roll. Meaning, your Tenacity of Might vs. your Opponents Fortitude of Psyche in Combat and in Social encounters. 

>*How does a roll occur, and how is a contest resolved?*

Let's say the above occurs, and you roll your Tenacity of Might. Which dice do you use? How many? Is it all of them?

No. We'll be using a basic d20 system for now, where you roll a d20 and then add the total Attribute, the Attribute subtype, or multiple subtypes if you're using a point of Versatility, and any item bonuses. 

#### Let's take Combat as an example.

So, let's say you've put 3 points into Tenacity and 2 points into Aggression. On average, you're a more defensive character. You get attacked on the enemies turn, you roll to defend in the contest, and you add your Tenacity of Might to the roll. 

>You roll a 12 on the d20, and add 3, since that's your Tenacity, for a total of 15.

>Your enemy rolled a 10, plus 4 due to their higher Aggression score, for a total of 14.

You've won the contest, what happens now? 

The damage you do to the enemy is ALSO your Tenacity score. So you've dealt 3 damage to your enemy by just winning the contest. You'll also have some extra benefits from using any of your Attribute subtypes, and you may also have extra benefits from your equipped items.

*So what happens if you tie?*

In combat, on that round you'll have used that Attribute subtype, Tenacity, so you'll need to choose another different subtype of a different Attribute to add to the roll and you'll need to explain how you're using the subtype in aid of the roll. You could go with Acuity and state you're trying to turn the contest back on the enemy. On adding that, if it's still a tie, you'll continue until someone loses, but the damage will still be the original subtype modifier used.

#### What about Social encounters?

All of the above is the same in Social circumstances, however the DM might sometimes create a Threshold for you beat. 
On a tie of a Threshold, you may need to do the same as the combat rules, however depending on the circumstance, that Threshold may either stay the same or increase.


## *Versatile Rolls*

Using a point of Versatility will allow you to further enhance your characters abilities and characterization, however it doesn't come without risks. 

>If you fail the Versatile Roll, you will lose that point of Versatility for the day.

Spending all your versatility points on failed rolls will put you at risk, as you'll no longer be able to bolster certain decisions with other attributes.

To make a Versatile Roll, you'll need to declare three things.

1. That you are making a Versatile Roll before the roll.
2. Which attribute you are using as the Main attribute of the roll.
3. Which attribute you are using to assist the main attribute, and how it assists.

To show, I want to attack an enemy. I choose to use the free Attack ability, and I've seen this particular enemy have a high defense, so I want to knock it off balance. 

Therefore I'll use Aggression for my Main attribute of the attack, but I'll also use Acuity to enable my attack to target the balance of the enemy and find a small gap in their defences. 

Or I'll use Speech to throw them off mentally. Or I'll use Silence to make the enemies perception of me become more intimidating.

However you want to justify it, make a choice for how you enable this Attack to happen and the Runner will do their best to incorporate it.

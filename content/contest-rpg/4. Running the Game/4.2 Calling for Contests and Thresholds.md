The Game Runner will describe the scenarios and situations, will play the people and creatures you encounter and be the arbiter of all rules decisions. It's recommended to write down the rules decisions for consistency to refer back to, so inconsistent rulings don't become unfair.

The Runner will call for contests to decided the things that cannot be decided by roleplay.

Whether it's combat or social, the Runner on their turns will first state the Attribute subtype/s used, choose which is their Main attribute for it, and the threshold of the contest for Social contests, or the total roll to beat in Combat encounters.
Then they will ask for your intention on how you plan to beat that threshold or roll, and which Attribute subtype you want to use.

On the player turns, they will essentially do the same thing, state their intention, what they're using and what the Runner needs to beat.
